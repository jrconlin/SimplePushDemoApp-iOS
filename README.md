#SimplePush Demo iOS App

This app exists solely to test APNS proprietary pings for SimplePush.

Yes, that's a bit of word salad.

In short, SimplePush allows devices (like Android and iOS) to use
native messaging systems (like GCM and APNS) to send Push
Notifications from servers to devices. This cuts down on battery and
CPU demand, while giving App and site developers a consistent way to
send pings and (small amounts of data) to remote devices.
